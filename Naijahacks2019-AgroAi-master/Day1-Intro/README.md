# Problem

Early and adequate detection as well as diagnosis of crop diseases and pest, detection of soil time and possible
neutrient level as well as viable produce.

# Proposed Solution

A machine learning application in the agricultural sector.
The project is the creation of a neural network that can automatically detect a series of possible plant diseases
depending on the physical symptoms displayed by the plant, this project would be looking at individual plants and 
working with them on at a time i.e for casssava we look at its diseases, we train the neural network to identify 
the physical symptoms of its diseases, we acheive a degree of accuracy we are satisfied with, we the move on to
another plant doing the same thing.
We also want to dectect the soil type, recommend viable farm produce to give the highest yield taking into consideration
average cost of farming the produce, period of time until harvest, possible return using the current selling price of the 
crop.
The kind of system to be built is an image recognition system(Yet to be finalised)
This will enable the users simply take a picture and feed it to the neural network when they need to use it
